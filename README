Directory layout is as follows:
    bin/                      programs to build the site etc.
    lib/                      Template Toolkit templates
    src/                      actual text of the site
    www/                      output goes here
    perl_mongers.xml          PM group listing data to build corresponding pages from
    perl_mongers.dtd          definition for perl_mongers.xml format

To build the site, run "bin/xml".

Your local www directory should simply be a symlink into
a WebDAV mount of https://groups.pm.org/admin/. For example, in OS X:
   
      ln -s /Volumes/admin/groups/www www
   
At that point, when you run "bin/xml" you're publishing the output directly 
to www.pm.org.

What "bin/xml" does is it takes the source files from src/ applies any
templates to them (from lib/), and writes the output to the www/
directory.

lib/layout is the template which is applied to every page.

Note: whenever you refer to a page on our site inside a template,
please use the following mechanism, which changes the link to a
relative one so that we can build the site anywhere we want:

  See [% link_to("foo.html", "the best foo") %].
