<h3>
    Why don't you offer service X?
</h3>
<p>
    Probably for security or cost reasons.
</p>
<h3>
    Do I have to host my PM group website on your server?
</h3>
<p>
    See below.  We don't offer web page hosting anymore.  We will
    happily provide you with either a DNS pointer to your own
    hosting or a HTTP 301 redirect.
</p>
<h3>
  Didn't you previously offer basic web hosting?
</h3>
<p>
  Yes, we did.  We stopped offering it to new groups in 2014.  It was
  a lot of upkeep for a relatively low benefit.  While it made sense
  for us to offer this service in 1999, fifteen years later there are
  lots of good, free hosting options.  We
  suggest <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>
  or <a href="https://sites.google.com">Google Sites</a>.

    <a href="#dns">*</a><a name="dns"></a>
    DNS and Redirects
</h2>
<h3>
    Why would I want to change the DNS for my group?
</h3>
<p>
    Because you want to host your group's web server on a server you control.
    We're happy to point yourgroup.pm.org DNS to your server(s).
</p>
<h3>
    Can I get a HTTP redirect instead?
</h3>
<p>
    We'll gladly setup a HTTP 301 redirect from yourgroup.pm.org to
    anywhere else.  (For example http://yourgrouppm.github.io/ or
    http://somewhere.somedomain.com/yourgroup/)
</p>
<h3>
    Will you delegate NS for my group?
</h3>
<p>
    No, sorry. Recent security exploits have convinced us not to delegate DNS
    offsite.
</p>
<h3>
    Will you point MX records to my SMTP server?
</h3>
<p>
    We will only do this for established groups. After you've had a few
    meetings, send us your <code>hostname(s)</code> to which you would like
    yourgroup.pm.org MX to be directed. (MX records work on hostnames, not IP
    addresses.)

    Email Forwarding
</h2>
<h3>
    Can you forward email sent to</a> groupname@pm.org (e.g.: omaha@pm.org)?
</h3>
<p>
    Yes, if you explicitly ask for that. Send a request to
    support(at)pm(dot)org, specifing the address you would like us to forward
    to. You must be the group admin for that group.
</p>
<h3>
    Can you forward email sent to username@pm.org (e.g.: jay_hannah@pm.org)?
</h3>
<p>
    No, we don't do this. It's proven to be too much maintenance. Sorry.
</p>


<hr>
<h2>
    <a href="#mailman">*</a><a name="mailman"></a>
    Group Mailing Lists
</h2>
<p>
    If you like, we'll host a Mailman mailing list for your group. You'll
    administer your list via the web interface (<a href=
    "http://www.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/groupname">http://www.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/groupname</a>)
    and/or by emailing commands to the Mailman server.
</p>
<p>
    Also, as a group leader, you'll be added to a mailing list of your fellow
    administrators from around the world. It's a low-volume
    announcement-centric list.
</p>
<h3>
    You use Mailman on a Perl web site? Are you a secret Python programmer?
</h3>
<p>
    Mailman is better than Majordomo. Deal with it. 
</p>

<h2>
    <a href="#new">*</a><a name="new"></a>
    How do I request a new group or to reactivate a group that has been inactive?
</h2>
<p>
    99% of the time your group name will be the name of the city in which your
    meetings will typically be held. So, since I live in Omaha my group name is
    Omaha.pm.
</p>
<p>
    We will not create new groups with short names, please do not ask.
    Some groups (i.e. New York as ny.pm) are grandfathered in.  Names
    should be descriptive and mean something to non-residents.  For
    example: MinneapolisStPaul.pm is best.  TwinCities.pm would be ok
    too (as that's a common and well known nickname for the area.)  If
    the nickname is not well known, expect pushback.  MSP.pm would be
    rejected.
</p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
    Send an email to support(at)pm(dot)org. The subject should be ``Omaha.pm -
    new group request'' or similar. Your email needs to include all of the
    following:
</p>
<pre>
    Group leader name
    Group leader email address
    City
    State/Province
    Region (if applicable)
    Continent
    Country
    Latitude   (in decimal format like "41.224853")
    Longitude  (in decimal format like "-96.122798")
    ... and the answers to the 2 questions below:
</pre>
<h4>
    (1) Where are you going to host your site's website?
</h4>
<p>
  Please provide <b>one</b> of the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>URL to redirect yourgroup.pm.org to</li>
  <li>IP address of server hosting your group's website</li>
  <li>hostname (for a CNAME record) the server hosting your group</li>
</ul>
<h4>
    (2) Do you want us to host a Mailman mailing list for you?
</h4>
<p>
    Indicate yes or no.
</p>
<p>
    Once you've sent that email you should get a reply back from
    RequestTracker, the ticketing system we use. A volunteer administrator
    should be in touch in a week or so.

</p>
<pre>
    &lt;script language="JavaScript" src="http://www.perl.org/misc/site-sponsor-js.html"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

<p>
    The output width is fixed at 180, but the height is variable. If you want
    to personalize the text message, you can add '?notext=1' to the src string.

<h2>
    <a href="#www">*</a><a name="www"></a>
    Maintaining my groups website on the pm.org server
</h2>

<p>
  This section only applies to groups who are grandfathered into the
  pm.org hosting.  We no longer offer this service to new groups and
  will be phasing it out over time.  See above for details.
</p>

<h3>
    How do I upload files?
</h3>
<p>
    Access is only supported through <a href="http://www.webdav.org">WebDAV</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Recent versions of Windows and Mac OS X have DAV clients built in. Many
    Linux desktop tools do as well.
</p>
<p>
    For a simple UNIX command line client, try <a href="http://www.webdav.org/cadaver">cadaver</a>.
</p>
<h3>
    Where do I get a username/password?
</h3>
<p>
    Go to <a href="http://svn.perl.org/">http://svn.perl.org/</a> and sign up
    for a username. You must notify support(at)pm(dot)org so they can associate
    that username with your pm group.
</p>
<h3>
    What if I forget my password?
</h3>
<p>
    <a href="http://svn.perl.org/">http://svn.perl.org/</a> tells you how to
    reset your password.
</p>
<h3>
    Where do I upload files?
</h3>
<p>
    https://groups.pm.org/groups/yourgroup/
</p>
<p>
    You must use the 'real' name of your group, not one of its aliases. (i.e.
    philadelphia, not philly or phl)
</p>
<h3>
    What is my group website?
</h3>
<p>
    http://yourgroup.pm.org
</p>


<h3>
   WebDAV on Mac OS X
</h3>
<p>
    Download and trust the <a href="http://ca.develooper.com/install.html">Develooper 
    Root certificate</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Finder -&gt; Go -&gt; Connect to Server. Server address:
</p>
<pre>
  https://groups.pm.org/groups/yourgroup
</pre>
<p>
    That's it. You now have access to our server via WebDAV just like any other
    network drive.
</p>


<h3>
    WebDAV on Windows
</h3>
<p>
    Download and trust the <a href="http://ca.develooper.com/install.html">Develooper 
    Root certificate</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Start -&gt; My Network Places -&gt; Add a Network,
  plug in your group web access URL:
<pre>
  https://groups.pm.org/groups/yourgroup
</pre>
  and it creates a directory where you can just copy/paste files.
</p>


<h3>
    How do I use cadaver?
</h3>
<p>
    Cadaver works just like most command line FTP clients.
</p>
<pre>
    $ cadaver https://groups.pm.org/groups/yourgroup
    Authentication required for perl.org on server `groups.pm.org':
    Username: yourusername
    Password: yourpassword
</pre>
<p>
    Important commands: get put ls
</p>


<h3>
    Why can't I use an FTP client?
</h3>
<p>
    Because DAV integrates better with our Authentication and Access Control
    system. Also, DAV runs over SSL (https) so passwords (and data) are
    encrypted in transit.
</p>


<h3>
    Is there a quota?
</h3>
<p>
    There is no hard limit, but we are monitoring disk usage carefully. If a
    group uses an inappropriate amount of disk space, they will be removed from
    the server.
</p>
<h3>
    <a name="what_can_i_upload" id="what_can_i_upload">What can I upload?</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Things related to your Perl Monger group.
</p>
<h3>
    <a href="#ssl">*</a><a name="ssl"></a>
    Why don't you have a real SSL certificate?
</h3>
<p>
    Because we're cheapskates.
</p>
<p>
    Download and trust the <a href="http://ca.develooper.com/install.html">Develooper 
    Root certificate</a>.
